# galaxy_portfolio

This site was built and published in less than a week and needs some tweaking. It features both my own code and open source code. All graphics on the site are original unless otherwise noted.

Primary Web Languages that were used are HTML, CSS and Javascipt. Bootstraps and jQuery were the frameworks and libraries used to assist the development of this site, as well as some open source templates.

[Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - This portfolio used the template [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)
